## How to add your achievements

To add your custom achievement pack, first you need to create a new .lua file at the path: `scripts/omw_achievements/achievements` (since version 2.1.0).

For example, `scripts/omw_achievements/achievements/myAchievementsPack.lua`.

This .lua file should return a table with achievements, where each achievement is a separate table.

Example: 

```lua
local myAchievements = {
    {
        type = "single_quest",
        name = "MyAchievement",
        description = "MyAchievement Description",
        journalID = "quest_journal_id",
        stage = 100,
        operator = function(self, givenStage)
            return givenStage >= self.stage
        end,
        icon = "Icons\\MAC\\icn_my_achievement_icon.dds",
        id = "my_ach_01",
        hidden = false
    }
}

return myAchievements
```

Once you start the game, your achievements will appear at the end of the widget list.
