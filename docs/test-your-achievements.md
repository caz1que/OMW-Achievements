# How to test your achievements

I highly recommend testing achievements in debug mode. Especially if you want to get them in your playthrough later.

**How to enable debug mode in the OpenMW launcher:**

Go to "Settings" -> "Debug" -> tick the checkbox "Skip menu and create a default character".

This will create a new save directory.

## How to test getting achievement type "single_quest"

1. Open the game console (by default ~).
2. Enter the command `journal "<journalID>" <stage>`, where:
- journalID - key `journalID` from the table of your achievement
- stage - key `stage` from the table of your achievement
3. If all is well, you will receive a notification that the achievement has been unlocked, and in the achievements widget it will be marked as "unlocked".

## How to test getting achievement type "multi_quest"

1. Open the game console (by default ~).
2. The process is the same as in "single_quest", but the 'journal' command must be entered for each quest. The order in which the commands are executed does not matter.
3. If all is well, you will receive a notification that the achievement has been unlocked, and in the achievements widget it will be marked as "unlocked".

## How to test getting achievement type "talkto"

There are two options:

- Create a new copy of the NPC and place it right in front of the player using the console command: `player->placeatme "<recordId>" 1,1,1 1`, where `recordId` is the value of the `recordId` key from your achievement table

After that, you should start a dialogue with this NPC. If all is well, you will receive a notification that the achievement has been unlocked, and in the achievements widget it will be marked as "unlocked".
